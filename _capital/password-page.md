If you aren't ready to open your shop to the public yet, you can enable a password page. The password page blocks customers from accessing your under-construction store, and it allows you to give a password to anyone who needs access to the shop before you open.

You can enable a password page from the **Online Store â–º Preferences** page in your Shopify admin area. Scroll to the **Password page** section at the bottom of this page.

If you have your mailing list info set up in the your footer settings, Capital's password page will display a newsletter signup form when customers land on the password page. They can use the **Enter store using password** link to proceed and enter a password.

_To access Capital's currency settings, select **Currency** from the **General settings** tab of your theme settings._


The currency settings allow you to select whether you want to allow customers to view your store with prices in their local currency.

If enabled, customers can choose currencies from a dropdown menu in the header, right next to the search bar.

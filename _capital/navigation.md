Capital has a navigation menu that's great for stores with large inventories. If you are looking to customize the navigation menus, these settings tie in with Capital's departments features. You should set up departments before configuration the navigation settings. See [Departments](../departments) for more information.

## Departments navigation image

When the departments navigation menu is open, you can choose to display an image within it using the **Enable departments navigation image** checkbox and the **Choose image** upload form. When enabled, the image appears right-aligned inside the menu. Here's an example of what this looks like in a shop using Capital:

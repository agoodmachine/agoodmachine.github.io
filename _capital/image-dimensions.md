In order to perfect the look and feel of your shop, we want to provide recommended image dimensions for all of your shop's images. While you're welcome to upload other image sizes and aspect ratios, we guarantee that these sizes will make your shop look great.

Just so you know, the measurements on this page are in pixels, and they are ordered **_width_ x _height_**. Unless your customers use high DPI displays, Capital scales down the images so they fit perfectly in your customers's browser window.

## Logo

For your logo image, we recommend an image **480px x 84px**.

The maximum logo image size is **600px x 84px**.

You can upload a logo from the [Header](../header) settings.

## Departments navigation image

For the departments navigation menu image, we recommend a super wide image of **1288px x 250px**. We think a marketing banner or a transparent version of your store's logo would look great in this area.

You can upload a departments navigation image from the [Navigation](../navigation) settings.

## Image gallery home page section

Image galleries let you display a slideshow-like block with links to your different departments, or any other page of your shop. By default, each image is a landscape-style item, but you can change any image into a portrait item. Portrait items take up the space required for _two_ landscape items. Here's a layout example with one portrait and two landscape items configured:

![One portrait image and two landscape images items](../images/image-gallery-section-size.png)

You can configure up to _eight_ departments for each departments section on your home page. Up to _four_ display at one time, and customers can use navigational arrows to scroll to the remaining departments.

### Dimensions

Here are our recommended image dimensions for the Image Gallery :

- Portrait item: **940px x 1268px**
- Landscape item: **940px x 614px**
- Single landscape item: **1920px x 626px**
- Single portrait item: **1920px x 1252px**

## Blog post featured image

For blog posts, we recommend that you use large images, at least **1280px wide**. It does not matter how tall the image is, although landscape images look good consistently.

## Collection image

Collection images are set up using the Shopify admin area when you add or edit collections. For Capital, we recommend that your collection image be **940px x 614px**.

For [lookbook collections](../lookbook-collections), we recommend that your collection image be at least **1280px wide**.

## Product images

Product images are set up using the Shopify admin area when you add or edit products. For Capital, you can configure the aspect ratio for product images from the [Product item](../product-item) settings. Depending on which aspect ratio you have configured, we recommend different sizes for your product images.

_For best results, we recommend that you use images that are the same size for all of your products._

- Natural: **880px wide**, no recommended height.
- 3:2: **880px x 586px**.
- 1:1: **880px x 880px**.
- 2:3: **880px x 1320px**.


If you are unfamiliar with how image aspect ratios work, here is a diagram showing what 3:2, 1:1, and 2:3 images look like:

For more information about products and examples of product images in Capital, see [Products](../products).

## Password page background image

If your store isn't open yet, you can stop customers from accessing it by setting up a password-protected storefront. See the [Password page](../password-page) page for more information about this. When the password page is set up, you can configure a background image to be displayed on that page.

We recommend that your password page background image be **1920px x 1252px**.

The top bar feature places a simple message at the top of each page of your shop. It's a great way to link your customers to the latest news, a new product collection, or a selection of sale items. You can link to any URL in your shop, or even a different website.

The banner uses your shop's accent color. You can set the accent color from your [Color settings](../colors).

## Footer background color

The footer generates its own background color based on your configured accent color and borders color. Together, they'll create an on-brand color that allows customers to easily read the footer information. The footer background is not manually configurable.

## Borders

If you are wondering what colors the **Borders** setting affects, look for the lines that divide sections on the page, or the lines around the newsletter signup form, variant pickers, and dropdown menus throughout the store.

Capital's collections are built to handle lots of products. Capital uses the typical product collection features you've come to expect from Shopify. Shopify has a guide to collections on their help center: [Building product collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections).

  - See our recommended image dimensions for your collection images (and every other image in Capital) on the [Image dimensions](../image-dimensions) page.
  - For more information about how product collections can be configured specifically in Capital, see [Collection](../collection).
  - For more information about the lookbook collection template, see [Lookbook collections](../lookbook-collections).

Below are a few images of how you can expect your product collections to look when you're using Capital.

## Lookbook collections

There is a special collection template for any collection you want to stand out, be it for a special event, a special product line, or to showcase products that go well together. You can learn how to set up a lookbook-style collection from the [Lookbook collections](../lookbook-collections) article.

## Blog excerpts

You may notice that your blog posts get cut off on the blog index and end in the middle of a sentence.

You can fix this by using the **Add excerpt** feature when you are adding or editing blog posts. For more information about Shopify's blog excerpts feature, see their article [Show excerpts from your blog posts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/online-store/blogs/writing-blogs#show-excerpts-from-your-blog-posts).

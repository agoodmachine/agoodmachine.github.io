Capital provides banners that appear on product images when there is noteworthy information about the product available. For example, if a product is sold out, the **Sold out** banner identifies this. This page shows examples of all available product banners and describes when they appear in your shop.

Below is an image with all of the possible banners that can appear on your products:

Note that if more than one banner could be applied to a product, the banners prioritize in the following order:

  1. **New** or **Popular**
  2. **Sold out**
  3. **Low stock**
  4. **Percent off**

For example, if a product is low in stock, but it is also a popular item, the **Popular** banner is applied due to the Popular banner's priority.

## New

The **New** banner only appears on department pages and collection list pages if the collection's default sorting method is set to **By date: Newest to oldest**. You can set a collection's default sorting method when you are adding or editing the collection. For more information, see Shopify's article [Change the sort order for the products in a collection](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/collection-layout#change-the-sort-order-for-the-products-in-a-collection).

## Popular

The **Popular** banner only appears on department pages and collection list pages if the collection's default sorting method is set to **By best selling**. You can set a collections default sorting method when you are adding or editing the collection. For more information, see Shopify's article [Change the sort order for the products in a collection](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/collection-layout#change-the-sort-order-for-the-products-in-a-collection).

## Sold out

The **Sold out** banner appears on any product that is out of stock according to Shopify's own inventory tracking feature. You can manually change the number of items in stock when adding or editing a product in the Shopify admin area. For more information about managing inventory in Shopify, see Shopify's article [Managing your inventory](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/inventory).

## Low stock

The **Low stock** banner displays a message, **Only [number] left** on any item in your shop, according to your configured low stock indication. You can set the number that Capital considers as low stock in the [Product item](../product-item#low-stock) settings.

## Percent off

The **Percent off** banner displays a message, **[Percentage]% off** on any item in your shop if you have set a **Compare at** price when you added or edited the item in your Shopify admin area.

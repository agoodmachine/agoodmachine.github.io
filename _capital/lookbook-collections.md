You can take any collection page in Capital and apply a lookbook layout to it. The lookbook layout enlarges the collection's featured image, giving the collection underneath a more unified look and feel. The lookbook collection layout is perfect for special collections, like curated outfits or products that should be bought as a set.

You can make assign the lookbook layout to any collection when you are adding or editing it from your Shopify admin area. Look for the **Templates** settings while you are editing the collection details and change the dropdown from `collection` to `collection.lookbook`.

Shopify offers a customer accounts feature that allows customers to save their information for future purchases. Capital makes it easy for returning customers to log in by providing a customer account button in your shop's top menu, right next to the cart button.

As seen in the above image, you can show a condensed version of your shop's contact information from the customer accounts menu. For instructions on setting this up, see the [Header](../header#accounts-dropdown) article.

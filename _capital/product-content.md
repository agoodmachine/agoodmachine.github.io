You can adjust what information product pages display in Capital. Most of the settings live in the general settings area under [Product item](../product-item). However, if you want to add a related products block or a recently viewed products block, then you need to go to the **Product content** settings area. In order to get there, you need to navigate to a product page while using Shopify's theme editor. That way, the **Product content** area appears in the list of theme settings, and you can preview the changes you make to those settings right away.

  <dd>Select this checkbox to turn on a related products block on each product page. Related products are any products that are in the same collection as the selected product. <a href="#related-products">See an example</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Enable recently viewed products</dt>
  <dd>Select this checkbox to turn on a recently viewed products block on each product page. This shows your customers other products they have recently looked at. <a href="#recently-viewed-products">See an example</a>.</dd>

## Related products

The related products block can be enabled using the **Enable related products** checkbox. This displays a list of related products from your shop. The list is generated by any products that belong in the same collection as the selected product.

If the item is not in a collection with other products, Capital will search for another product collection. It goes through your collections alphabetically and picks the first collection with products in it. The `all` and `Frontpage` collections are skipped.

## Recently viewed products

The recently viewed products block can be enabled using the **Enable recently viewed products** checkbox. This displays a list of products that the customer has looked at.

In addition to seeing this section on product pages, you can enable it on the cart page from the [Cart](../cart) settings.

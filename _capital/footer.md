Capital's footer is a rich customizable area. You can choose to show lots of store information or just a little.

When your store is viewed on a mobile device, the footer appears underneath the navigation menu when the menu button (☰) in the left-hand corner of each page.

## Profile links

You can also add profile links to all of your social media accounts from the [Social media](../social-media) settings on the **General settings** tab in your theme editor.

Below is an image that shows all of the available social media icons in Capital.

## Menus

You can assign any two navigation menus to be displayed in the footer using the **Show menu 1** and **Show menu 2** dropdown menus. You could create special footer-specific navigation menus, use some of your existing navigation menus (like the [Departments](../departments) menu), or both.

If you need more information about navigation menus, see Shopify's article [Menus and links](https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/online-store/menus-and-links).

## Show shop contact information

Use the **Show shop contact information** checkbox to display the contact information from your shop's account information on the **Settings ► General** area of your Shopify admin.

## Show payment icons

Use the **Show payment icons** checkbox to display any payment methods that your shop accepts. Capital automatically grabs the list of payment methods you accept and displays them, so no other configuration is required.

See Shopify's article [Payment settings](https://help.shopify.com/manual/payment-settings) if you need more information about setting up payment methods.

## Mailing list segments {#mailing-list-segments}

Using Capital's mailing list footer block, you can hook up multiple [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com) mailing lists to segment your subscribers based on their interests.

To set this up:

  1. Within your theme settings, click to open the **Footer** menu under the **Section** settings.
  2. Click the **Add mailing list segment** button.
  3. Fill out the **Title** field with your preferred segment title.
  4. Paste in your form action URL for the matching mailing list within the **Mailchimp form action URL** field. It should look something like this: `//yourstore.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3243gh32423723324gh3243g3&amp;id=a43674387"`.

You can learn more about the form action URLs required from Shopify's article [Get a MailChimp form action URL](https://help.shopify.com/themes/customization/communication/get-a-mailchimp-form-action-url).

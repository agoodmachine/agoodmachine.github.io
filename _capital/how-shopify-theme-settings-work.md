If you don't see a particular setting that we mention in one of these articles, you may just need to change which page of your store you are previewing.

For example, if you want to change settings for the [cart](../cart) page, you should go to the cart page in your store preview. Doing this will reveal any cart-specific settings in the list of available theme settings. Similarly, you may want to navigate to a [collection page](../collections), [your store's homepage](../add-homepage-sections), or a [product page](../product-content) to see theme settings that are specific to those sections of your store.

Capital's cart layout makes for a streamlined, responsive path to checkout. It displays an easy-to-read summary of the product information in the cart. Customers are not likely to order the wrong size, color, or quantity of their items.

You can change how the cart appears to customers from Capital's theme settings. To access the cart settings, preview the cart page while you are customizing Capital and choose **Cart content** from the list of available sections.

Settings include a shipping rate calculator, an order message form for customers, and a recently viewed products widget.

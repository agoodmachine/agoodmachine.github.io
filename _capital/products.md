Capital provides a simple product page layout that makes your product information easy to read. You can also set up related products and recently viewed products blocks that help your customers quickly browse any other products they're interested in.

  - See our recommended image dimensions for your product images (and every other image in Capital) on the [Image dimensions](../image-dimensions) page.
  - Product pages can be adjusted quite a few different ways. For more information, see [Product item](../product-item) and [Product content](../product-content).

Here are a few images showcasing Capital's product pages and what your product pages could look like:

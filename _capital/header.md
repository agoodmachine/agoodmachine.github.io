Capital's header area includes a configurable logo and quick search menu.

If [Shopify customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/customers/customer-accounts) are enabled, you can also configure dropdown store contact information.

## Logo

You can enable or disable your custom logo. When the logo is disabled or cannot be loaded for some reason, customers see the header font you have configured in your [Typography](../typography) settings. It will also use the header color you have configured in your [Colors](../colors) settings.

<dl>
  <dt>Enable logo</dt>
  <dd>Select this checkbox to enable the custom logo.</dd>
  <dt>Logo image</dt>
  <dd>Upload an image to use for the logo or select an existing image from your library.</dd>
  <dt>Logo width (in pixels)</dt>
  <dd>The logo image's width in pixels.</dd>
</dl>

See our recommended image dimensions for your logo (and every other image in Capital) on the [Image dimensions](../image-dimensions) page.

## Search

The search button reveals a store-wide search box that customers can use to search for products. When the search box has been activated, there is space underneath it for a navigation menu. This allows you to link to anything in your store that you think customers should see. You can use any of your shop's existing menus or create a specific menu for quick searches.
